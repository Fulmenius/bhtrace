## Description

This library designed for modeling images of compact objects in arbitrary spacetimes, especially for the case of compact objects, sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics.

Two approaches are developed:
1) First approach follows standard ray-tracing procedure.
2) [WIP] Another approach is based upon Hamilton-Jacobi equations and strong gravitational lensing. Coordinates of photons on observers sky are gained through solution of integral equations.
